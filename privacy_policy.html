    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect or transmit personal data, there is minimal security risk. All app data is stored
        locally on your device and protected by your device's built-in security features. We recommend:

        <li>Using device lock screens and encryption</li>
        <li>Only downloading the app from official app stores</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Zombees Guides is intended for users aged 13 and older, consistent with the age rating of
        Call of Duty games. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
        The app does not require age verification since no personal data is collected.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Internet Connection</h2>

        date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Continued use of the
        app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

        of their respective owners.
    </p>

    <h2>10. International Users</h2>

        data residency laws do not apply to that content. However, analytics and advertising data collected by
        Google (Analytics and AdMob) may be transferred and processed internationally in accordance with Google's
        privacy practices and applicable data protection laws including GDPR.
    </p>
